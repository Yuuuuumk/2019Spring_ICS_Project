#1 GUI with registration (PyQt)
To run the files, open chat_server.py first and then open GUI.py.
To register, you type "register _name_ password". To login, you type "_name_ password".
All the registered usernames and passwords are remembered as long as chat_server.py is running.

#2 Blackjack GUI (TkInter)
Run Blackjack.py to play. Hit/pass when you see the cards, and continue by pressing the button "Deal".

#3 Integrating Chatting GUI and Blackjack GUI
Haven't started yet, but the plan was to put both features in the same GUI. (so one GUI needs to change its GUI library.)
Eventually, 2+ players can join in the server and they take turns in the role of dealer.
